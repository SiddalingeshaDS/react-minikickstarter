# Mini-Kickstarter : Basic Idea Collection App built in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the guide about react [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Objective
This application was built to understand and learn about the ReactJS library. In this project I built a simple form application with basic features to validate form elements and store the same in server.

## Pre-requisites
This project requires npm to be installed to run.

## Installing and Running
Download the repository and run the application using the following command.

``` bash
  $> npm start
```
