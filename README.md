# Basic To-Do App built in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the guide about react [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Objective
This application was built to understand and learn about the ReactJS library. In this project I built the todo application with basic features to add,delete, toggle complete todo items and store the same in server.

## Pre-requisites
This project requires npm to be installed to run.

## Installing and Running
Download the repository and run the application using the following command.

``` bash
  $> npm start
```

## Credits
This project was built as part of the tutorial: [Build Your First Production Quality React App](https://egghead.io/courses/build-your-first-production-quality-react-app) in [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

An excellent and well paced tutorial.
